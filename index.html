		<p>The first div is your container, what your content will be stored in. By defining it's class as "container_12", you're saying: "I want this container to have a 12 column grid" (The same practice applies when using a 16 and 24 column grid).

Now that you've defined the container as a 12 column layout, you begin to structure your site in such a way that it fits within the layout. If you look at the next div elements in the hierarchy (as noted by the tabs), you'll see the syntax for their definitions. "Grid_7" and "grid_3" are easy enough to understand: you're saying that this div element is going to take up X number of columns. However, 7+3 = 10 < 12, which means you'll have 2 empty columns at the end of the container, right? Well, this is where the prefix and suffix aspect of the class definition come into play. With a class definition of "grid_x suffix_y", you're saying: "I want this div to take up X columns, and for there to be Y number of empty columns after it." (This also applies to prefix). So, since "Grid_7" has a prefix of 1, and "Grid_3" has a suffix of 1, 7+3+1+1 = 12!</p>
